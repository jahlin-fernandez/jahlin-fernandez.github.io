My name is Jahlin Fernandez, and I am an artist and student at Columbia University originally from Newark, New Jersey. I am an artist with an extensive background in fiction, poetry, and visual arts, and I am very interested in the connection between image and story.

As a queer latinx student from a low income background, I have found that the content of my writing is so influenced by this perspective that it sometimes proves unreadable to those of drastically different backgrounds. This is highlighted by the content of my art, much of which explores poverty, difference, and isolation. In my writing and my art, I hope to convey personal history in a more universally relatable context by exploring difficult subjects through common themes like existentialism, dreams, and childhood.
